🧱 .NET Vertical Slice API — CQRS, DDD, JWT, Docker

A clean, production-ready .NET API showcasing Vertical Slice Architecture, CQRS, Mediator, DDD, JWT Authentication, Serilog logging, and both Unit & Integration testing.
Built as a demonstration of modern .NET backend development practices.


🚀 Overview

- This project is a fully structured .NET API designed using:
- Vertical Slice Architecture (feature-first organization)
- CQRS (clear separation between commands and queries)
- Mediator Pattern (request/response handling)
- Pipeline Behaviours (central logging, validation, and cross-cutting concerns)
- Serilog (structured file/log output)
- IOptions Pattern (strongly typed configuration)
- Result Pattern (clean error handling for expected failures)
- Global Exception Middleware (handling unexpected exceptions)
- Domain-Driven Design (entity models and domain logic)
- Entity Framework Core (SQL Server database access)
- JWT Bearer Authentication & Authorization
- Docker Compose for both database and published API
- xUnit & NSubstitute (unit tests)
- Integration tests using Docker SQL container

This project demonstrates clean architecture, maintainability, and real-world production patterns.
